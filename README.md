### _**Superstore Sales Dashboard**_
ðŸŽ¥ Sales dashoboard using a well known e-commerce dataset. <br> 
I wanted to use a well-known brand for the logo and theme, so I used Walmart. <br>
I used VLOOKUP to get unique customers and PIVOT TABLES to get the graphs and cards to interact with the year slicer together. <br>
The dashbaord shows sales by: <br>
 - Segment as percentage <br>
 - Category <br>
 - Sub-category <br>
 - Segment by month <br>
 - Top 5 states <br>
 - Bottom 5 states <br>
 - Total unique customers <br>
 - Total sales
